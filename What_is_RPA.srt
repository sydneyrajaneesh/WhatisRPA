00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,850
Rajaneesh Balakrishnan: Hi, welcome to the
community session on introduction to RPA.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,570
My self  Rajaneesh Balakrishnan
I am an UiPath MVP,  certified

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,000
advanced RPA developer and
founder of "2AutomateAnything".

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,980
This Orientation  session is for
anyone who is interested in RPA.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,169
or currently working in RPA.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,830
This will help you refresh your knowledge
to align with essential RPA concepts.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,150
Let's get started.

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:33,495
Today, we are going to discuss about RPA
in the context of digital transformation

9
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:38,745
from an enterprise perspective, how
to  define RPA and its characteristics

10
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:43,635
and benefits, how we can identify
automation  candidate from list of

11
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:46,625
business processes . RPA in Action.

12
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:51,765
using a sample business use case, and
finally list of all  our learnings.

13
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:53,025
I hope you all are ready.

14
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:53,955
Let's jump in.

15
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:57,614
Before I start talking anything about RPA.

16
00:00:57,855 --> 00:01:01,394
Let me give you a quick overview
on  Digital transformation, which

17
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,985
is a big thing in today's world.

18
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:08,965
In simple terms, replacing older
technology with newer Technology  is

19
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,775
called  digital transformation.

20
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:14,565
In other words, digital transformation.

21
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:19,155
It is an adoption of digital
technology to transform the services.

22
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:24,090
or , businesses through replacing
the non-digital or manual processes

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,350
with the digital process,.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,850
Automation plays a significant
role in digital transformation.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,440
However, there are many types
of automatio...Robotic process

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,450
automation, RPA plays a key role in
driving this digital transformation.

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,000
Now let's see what is RPA.

28
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,180
Robotic process automation, RPA.

29
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,620
This can be defined as automation
of work using digital robots.

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,430
Please.

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,590
Note these robots are not real robots
t or that you see in scifi movies.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,050
These are only for illustration purposes.

33
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,830
To expand it furth r..

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:06,809
It is a technology that allows the
computer software to mimic actions.

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,540
Typically perform by human users.

36
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:14,365
For digital systems to perform
the business processes.

37
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:20,094
Although robots perform multiple actions,
the key actions that are performed by

38
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:25,255
these Robots are, that they are able to
capture data from an applications are

39
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:28,794
from any input, input, data, et cetera.

40
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:35,740
Uh, it is able to run applications, um,
Based on the user interactions, it is able

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,640
to capture and run data on applications.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,310
It is able to trigger responses,
which means like it is able to act

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,180
based upon the given inputs, etc.

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,329
Able to communicate with
different multiple systems.

45
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,890
And also it is able to communicate
with human users, just for inputs.

46
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,160
Although these robots have
multiple characteristics.

47
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,990
Some distinctive characteristics
are such as they are able to emulate

48
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,290
human actions and these robots can
operate in multiple environments  or

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,000
applications that has user interface.

50
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,079
They can perform processes
using structured data format

51
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,220
and these robots, the specific.

52
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,930
use about these robots are
they're able to, uh, the robots

53
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,219
are able to work continuously
and has high degree of accuracy.

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,329
Now let us move on to the targeted
processes in any business  environment

55
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,130
settings, just to identify
the key automation candidates.

56
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,440
RPA  depends on certain rules.

57
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,969
Let us see this one  by one, the
first  of all , highly manual.

58
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,290
The process that are highly manual are
the best candidates for automation.

59
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,315
And second.

60
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:58,795
It's mostly repeatitive . And
time consuming process.

61
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:03,355
Some processes are repetitive in
nature and also it's highly complex

62
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:05,665
and it is mostly time consuming.

63
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:08,594
Next is the rule based.

64
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:13,034
So by rule based, I mean
the business processes.

65
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,144
Follow your standard structure.

66
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:19,255
That is the step by step instruction
to execute any business process.

67
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:24,295
This, this, these processes does
not change frequently and follow the

68
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,305
similar structure on daily basis.

69
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:31,375
Next is the low exception rate,
which means the system is stable

70
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,145
enough to perform the automation.

71
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,315
And there is not many exceptions are
raised during this business process

72
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:41,815
execution, and finally, the standard
electronically readable input.

73
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:47,075
In which the robots are easily able
to read these inputs from any files

74
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:51,505
or from, multiple applications, the
input  are in a standard readable input.

75
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:57,235
Now, let us see a  sample business use
case where a retail organization sends

76
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:59,635
contract to its hundreds of customers.

77
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:03,895
Uh, it just number repeater
and time consuming.

78
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:07,675
And this seems to be a
perfect automation candidate.

79
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:11,965
And let us look more details
into this business processes

80
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,034
and the types of data used.

81
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:20,384
So I'm just moving to , Uipath
studio X and, uh, uh, corresponding

82
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,974
folders  to deep dive into this.

83
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,515
Let me explain a little bit further that.

84
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:30,865
So I'm just opening up a
contract of sale template.

85
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:35,755
So this is the template used
by the business user, just to.

86
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,479
Copy and paste this company
name, the company address,

87
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,039
seller name and seller address.

88
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,729
This is going to be very dynamic and
this total amount is going to come

89
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,510
from sale of goods, uh, Excel data.

90
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:00,849
And along with that, uh, Sale Item
table and this exchange rates is going

91
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,070
to be highly dynamic on daily basis.

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,299
So the robot will.

93
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:09,240
Open Google to find the
exchange rate for that date.

94
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,860
And it's also going to paste
this logo for the seller and

95
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,719
the buyer along with the date.

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,770
So I'm just going to do it for only
one customer, um, considering the time.

97
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,640
And, uh, this robot is able to perform
for such operation for multiple customers.

98
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,760
So I'm just going to show you the
contract for sale of goods, mock data.

99
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,219
So where I have data for only one
customer, when the date is today and

100
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:46,780
the company name, company, address,
seller name seller address along with

101
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,599
the goods data, uh, which is this table.

102
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,110
So I'm expecting the robot
to copy the entire table and

103
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,360
paste it into that template.

104
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:58,840
And this total amount also
should be copied to the template.

105
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:04,314
And similarly for any number of contract
data, the robot will be able to do.

106
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:08,215
But for this example, I say tool,
I'm going to do it for only one day.

107
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:08,534
Yeah.

108
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:18,645
So let me, um, navigate to the studio
X in a high level, there are two steps.

109
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:22,934
One is to create a new copy from template
and second is to create the report.

110
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:28,645
So in the carete the report, So you
use the template and perform only

111
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:33,475
operations that is to copy and paste the
data from Excel to the word template.

112
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:39,145
And also it opens the, uh, the web
application for the currency conversion

113
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:43,615
just to, uh, convert the dollar values.

114
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:48,915
It's just from Euro to a university.

115
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:52,695
So it, but from all the operations
and everything, uh, we'll be

116
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,675
ready once this run is completed.

117
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,400
So let me,  perform , a quick run on,
on this process and see how it works.

118
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,740
I'm going to click on the Run project.

119
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,680
So you can see the Robot
has started executing.

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,840
It has open the contract of sale, the
contract of sale of goods, et cetera.

121
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,900
And the, um,

122
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:34,755
and  web application  so it's
performing all the operation.

123
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:38,655
So once all this application
are close, like we can check

124
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:41,714
how the execution takes place.

125
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,780
I think it has completed
all the operations.

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,370
Let me check the output tab so I
can see from the audit, it has used

127
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:03,420
the word document just to copy the
template, a contract template, and

128
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,400
it has used the Excel file to just
copy the data from Excel to the work.

129
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,140
And also it has used the web publication
just to perform a search for Euro to USD.

130
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,860
And finally it has closed all
the Applications . So Let me

131
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,770
check the contract of sale.

132
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,990
You can see the document is completed now.

133
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,970
So I'm just going to verify this ex
the document, the contract of sale.

134
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,950
So this has been highlighted only for,
uh, this, uh, verification purpose.

135
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,430
So this names has been modified.

136
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,100
Maybe just the buyer name and the
seller name, this seller address, uh,

137
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,800
and the table, this table has come from
the Excel along with just total value.

138
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,210
And the  exchange rate has
been  updated and apparently

139
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,620
the data also has been updated.

140
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,540
And one more update is the seller
logo and Buyer logo has been updated.

141
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,170
So imagine there is a hundreds
of templates like this

142
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,850
business user has to create.

143
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,689
So he no need to do all these repeated
and manual process for the entire day

144
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:18,670
instead of the robot can help him do this
job so he can focus on better, um, focus

145
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,800
on adding more value to his business
that is contacting the customer and focus

146
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,780
on the customer service perspective.

147
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,579
So ms.

148
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:33,390
Has, uh, so the robot has done
a very good job of doing this.

149
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:39,489
Uh, so you can imagine, uh, they can also
do it for hundreds of data and also can

150
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:45,250
implement sending the email automatically
to the configured customer and reading

151
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,579
the data from a database instead of Excel.

152
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,650
Now, let us discuss the benefits under RPA
provides an unlimited number of benefits.

153
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,900
Let us discuss the top three benefits.

154
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,595
Use RPA in business context.

155
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:04,135
First of all, it is
not - invasive by non-invasive.

156
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:08,755
I mean, it does not require any
IT Architecture change or deep

157
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:11,365
integration with underlying systems.

158
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:17,035
It provides fast, Reliable and cost
effective solutions for lightweight

159
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:20,185
integration into processes or IT assets.

160
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:26,920
Second, it is easy to scale the amount
of work  involved entirely  depends on

161
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:33,819
the process, uh, as change is expected to
happen frequently in the business context.

162
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,160
Um, so if an  RPA  solution is
used, the business can either

163
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,010
scale up or scale down the RPA
solutions based on the requirements.

164
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:50,740
Finally, it's future proof of technology
robots work with today's technology.

165
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,060
If the.

166
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:57,385
Technology changes in future the
